If you want override the builtin pages and widgets template, you can create a template in your own template folders same
path as the builtin.

For example, the path of builtin layout template is `templates/layout.html`, you can create a template also
named `layout.html` and put it in your template folders. The easiest way to override is just to copy the builtin
template content then modify the content yourself.
